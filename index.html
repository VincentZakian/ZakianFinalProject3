        Climate change is one of the biggest issues confronting our species today, and it is certainly one of the biggest issues in the United States. A major indicator, and concerning result, of climate change is the increase in heat waves in the United States. The graphic below provides CDC data showing heat wave trends from 1981 to 2010, a period when climate change made its way into the public consciousness of the U.S. The graphic shows the heat wave trends across 3 different metrics: Daily Maximum Temperature, Daily Maximum Heat Index, and Net Daily Heat Stress. The metrics remain consistent throughout the graphic, except for a few points where Daily Maximum Temperature gives us intriguing outliers in the data.

      <p class="story-text">
        Daily Maximum Temperature shows us that there were two major outlying points in the graphic. The major uptick in reported heat wave days in 1988 (especially according to Daily Maximum Temperature) and then a sudden spike leading to more consistent growth in the graphic starting in 2008, which followed a spike in only Daily Maximum Temperature in 2007.

      <h2 class="header"> What the Data Tells Us</h2>
      <p class="story-text">
        The spike in 1988 that came seemingly out of nowhere based on the results from the previous seven years was likely due to the major heat wave that engulfed the United States in the Summer of 1988. While Summer heat waves are not uncommon in Southern and Western parts of the U.S., what set the heat wave of 1988 back was that it stretched into the Midwest and East Coast. The 1988 heat wave is important, as the data shows us that it was an anomaly, and is therefore, historically significant. It was not a sign of things to come, and its numbers would not be matched for over a decade. In 1989, Heat wave days based on Daily Maximum Temperature dropped off by a staggering 40,000 reports, the largest year to year drop off the CDC has on record. However, according to Linda C. Ivany, a Professor in Syracuse University’s Environmental Science Department, many experts have pointed to the heat wave in 1988 as a major turning point in the attitude of Americans toward climate change.

      <p class="story-text">
        In 2007, there was a precursor to the heat waves we see regularly in the U.S. West Coast these days. Once again, what sets this heat wave apart from the natural ebbs and flows that the rest of the data set shows us is that this heat wave made its way to the Midwest of the U.S. Another major drop off in daily temperatures in 2008, made the 2007 heat wave seem like another anomaly. However, since 2008, the U.S. has seen consistent growth and higher averages of reported heat waves, and we have all seen the seemingly regular droughts on the West Coast. 

      </p>

       <p class="story-text">
        So, to what can we attribute the exponential growth of heat waves according to all three CDC provided metrics beginning in 2008? 

      </p> 

      <p class="story-text">
        According to Ivany, since the late 2000s, we have seen an uptick in urbanization in the U.S. While occasional heat waves or droughts have been common on the West Coast, continuous growth of cities has seen heat waves become more common on the East Coast, as urbanization causes emissions to grow.

      <h2 class="header">Population Talk</h2>

      <p class="story-text">
        Some sources have attempted to label climate change as an inevitable result of overpopulation in the U.S. However, according to the second graphic, the United States population has shown gradual increase, which does not account for the sudden spikes in heat waves, and certainly does not account for the spike beginning in 2008. While greater emissions can be attributed to growing populations, such a dramatic event like the one beginning in 2008 can only be attributed to lifestyle changes, or be deemed as an outlier. 

      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        With that being said, the data provided by the CDC should be a cause for concern, as should the aforementioned lifestyle changes. The tragic droughts and wildfires along the United States’ West Coast have become more and more common, and every second that United States citizens choose to ignore it are seconds we are losing with this great land. The writing has been on the wall since 1988, likely before then too, and now the chickens are coming home to roost. The issue of climate change has been made more severe by the modern American lifestyle, and in order to fix the issue of climate change, we don’t need less people, we need more people willing to make a change to that lifestyle.
